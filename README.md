# patapon-autosplittes

Autosplitters made in order to facilitate speedrunning Patapon games.

Current version of autosplitters supports PPSSPP versions from 1.7 to 1.17.1.

If a new version of PPSSPP is released and autosplitters have not been updated or if you have any other questions related to the autosplitter, contact me on Discord: Maltaran#6060.

Warning: These are not final versions of autosplitters and have some known bugs. They have been added here anyway at the request of some people.
